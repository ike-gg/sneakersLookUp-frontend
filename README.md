# ðŸ‘‰ [Check demo](https://ike-gg.github.io/sneakersLookUp-frontend/)

Website allows you to search and add items to track from StockX website.
App uses API that i wrote myself [(repo here)](https://github.com/ike-gg/sneakersLookUp-backend).

Everything was written using React v18 & React Router v6.

### Disclaimer ðŸš¨

It is highly possible that my free-hosted heroku API will be limited, so you should host backend for yourself from [here](https://github.com/ike-gg/sneakersLookUp-backend).
But for use and just getting familiar something like preview, the free api should be enough, I think.
